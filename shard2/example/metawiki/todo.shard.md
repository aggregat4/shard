# TODO List for Shard Wiki ✓

## Do Sooner
1. ☑ have a static asset renderer on some paths (css/img/js or rather on "static" as an intermediate path?) that just feeds the files (some caching headers?)
2. ☑ use Twitter Bootstrap for the layout
3. ☑ get the first wiki page attempt going with read only (embedded markdown! use actuarius?)
4. ☑ Set the Content-Type for the response
5. ☑ allow linking
6. ☐ auto-render children list
7. ☐ auto-render attachment list
8. ☐ In-browser editing of pages
9. ☐ Side by side live editing of markdown: edit in textarea on the left, have auto-refresh on the right, with scrolling to position.

## Do Later
1. ☐ Link to pages in other wikis (really? do we need this?)

## Notes
* use the FontAwesome thing for icons
