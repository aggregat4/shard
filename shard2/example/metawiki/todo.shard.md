# TODO List for Shard Wiki
[x] have a static asset renderer on some paths (css/img/js or rather on "static" as an intermediate path?) that just feeds the files (some caching headers?)
[x] use Twitter Bootstrap for the layout
[ ] get the first wiki page attempt going with read only (embedded markdown! use actuarius? need to intercept certain directives (linking...)? auto-render children list, attachment list) 
[ ] use the FontAwesome thing for icons
[ ] Side by side live editing of markdown: edit in textarea on the left, have auto-refresh on the right, with scrolling to position.
[ ] Set the Content-Type for the response
