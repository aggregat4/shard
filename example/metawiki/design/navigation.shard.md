## Navigation Fallbacks

When someone requests some random page foo/bar in our wiki, we have the following fallback logic:
1. if the page (foo/bar.shard.md) exists display it, otherwise...
1. if it is a folder that exists, display the default page for that folder, otherwise fall back to the default folder page, and if it isn't a folder...
1. if the folder it _is in_ exists and has a default page (foo/foo.shard.md) display it, otherwise... 
1. if the folder itself exists then show a standard template the displays all contained Shard pages, other files, folders (3 columns) (foo/), otherwise ...
1. if the wiki exists, fall back to the root wiki page, otherwise ...
1. display a standard template page that allows one to create the wiki

During all this, as soon as we start falling back a level, add a [flash message](self:/page/design/flashmessages) to the list of flash messages.

Note: we need to redo the root wiki to have the name of the wiki in the shard page instead of "root".
